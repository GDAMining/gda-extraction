# gda-extraction
This repository contains the source code to train and test Biomedical Relation Extraction (BioRE) models on GDAb and GDAt datasets. GDAb and GDAt are large-scale, distantly supervised, and manually enhanced datasets for Gene-Disease Association (GDA) extraction. In addition, the repository contains scripts to compute datasets statistics and to convert other BioRE datasets in the required format. GDAb and GDAt datasets are also available at: insert-zenodo-url.
