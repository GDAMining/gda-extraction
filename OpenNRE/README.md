# OpenNRE

This repository contains the source code to implement Relation Extraction (RE) models within the OpenNRE framework. 
The RE models considered are: CNN, PCNN, BiGRU, BiGRU-ATT, and BERE. All models can be used with average-based or attention-based aggregation strategies under the Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) assumption.

The original OpenNRE framework can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE.
The original BERE implementation can be found at https://github.com/haiya1994/BERE.
